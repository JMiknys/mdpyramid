## .NET Core 2.0 console app

Features

* Use DP approach instead recursive for better performance

Ideas for future extension
* Most importantly add tests and do checks for edge cases in various components
* Componentise better the actual algorithm which would allow to have multiple algorithm implementations for this problem. An interesting idea would be to also implement algorithm recursively and benchmark the performance
* Add a simple console app type of menu which could be controlled by keyboard numerical inputs to allow customising input data or algorithm selection
